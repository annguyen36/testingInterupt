<H2>Purpose</H2>
The purpose of this assignment is to illustrate the use of interrupts in a
computer program, and to understand the mechanisms for executing an
interrupt.
<H2>Points</H2>
This project is worth 100 points.
<H2>Description</H2>
In this homework assignment, you are going to apply simple interrupts to
a program that calculate fibbinnoci numbers.  You will set a timer interrupt 
to go off every 100 microseconds, and count the number of times it actually
occurs.  By counting the number of interrupts that occur, you get a rough idea
of how long the program takes to calculate each fibbonacci number.<BR><BR>

The basic program to calculate
these numbers is in <A HREF="fib.c">fib.c</A>.  Using ualarm 
to set a 100
microsecond alarm clock interrupt, and using sigset to assign your own
interrupt vector for SIGALRM interrupts.
<H2>Hints</H2>
<LIST>
<LI>CTRL-C stops a program that is running.  In the first example, I override
the behavior of CTRL-C, so you cannot kill the program in that manner.
If you really screw up, get the PID, and type <I>kill -9 PID</I> (where obvioiusly
the PID is the process id, NOT PID).  You can also type CTRL-Z, which
will background the process, and if you then log out it will go away, but this
is not recommended.
<LI>Please do this assignment in Linux.  Yes, I know you CAN make it work on Windows
and MAC.  But if you are installing compilers on Windows to do this, you either 
already know all of this, or you probably have more guts than common sense or
brains.  MAC has different librarys, and I believe they are pushing you to
be POSIX complaint.  In either case, you are on your own, I will not answer any
pleas for help.

<LI>A program that uses the sigset function for SIGINT (control-c) is given
in <A HREF="sigint.c">sigint.c</A>
<LI> You can use gcc, cc, or g++ to do this assignment.  The easiest way to 
compile this program is to type "make sigint" and "make fib".  This will make
the sigint.c program to show the interrupts, and the fib program that you are 
to put the timer in.  If you want to change the compiler, use the CC 
environment variable to specify the compiler you want to use.  If you have to
ask how to do this, you probably shouldn't do it. 
<LI>There are man (manual) pages for the cc, sigset, and ualarm 
functions.  To get man pages, type "man <I>command</I>", for 
example man sigset, at the unix prompt.
